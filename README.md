# Earnings Call Sentiment Strategy

This project explores trading strategies by modeling sentiment extracted from earnings call transcripts alongside traditional technical indicators. The goal is to assess whether sentiment-aware models can enhance portfolio performance beyond baseline quantitative strategies.

## Strategies Implemented
### 1. Quantitative Strategy
- Inputs: Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, volatility, SMA, returns)
- Output: Trading signals (Buy/Sell/Hold)
- Model: Random Forest classifier trained per stock

### 2. Sentiment Strategy
- Inputs: FinBERT-based features from quarterly transcripts
- Features include: Mean & std of positive/neutral/negative sentiment, Polarity and polarity volatility, Max positive & min negative paragraph scores, Paragraph volume
- Output: Trading signals (Buy/Sell/Hold)
- Model: Random Forest classifier trained per stock
  
### 3. Benchmark
A static portfolio, entering 1000-share positions in all stocks on the first day and holding throughout the test period.

## Data Sources

- **Earnings Call Transcripts**  
  Transcripts were collected from a dataset released by Ashwin Mathur and are provided under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

- **Stock Price Data**  
  Daily historical price data for selected equities was retrieved using the [Yahoo Finance API](https://finance.yahoo.com/), via the `yfinance` Python library.

- **Sentiment Labels**  
  Generated using the [FinBERT](https://github.com/ProsusAI/finBERT) pre-trained model for financial sentiment analysis.
